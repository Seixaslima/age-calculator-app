  - The day number is not between 1-31 | completed
  - The month number is not between 1-12 | completed
  - The year is in the future | completed
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April) | completed
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size | completed
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page | completed
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted | to be implemented

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScrip](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Language

### What I learned

I improved my skills in React and TypeScript. I learned some ways to validate a form and improved my skills in creating an HTML layout.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

I need to improve my ability to use custom context on React and use better TypeScript language.
